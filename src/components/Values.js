                                Spirit, born of Virgin Mary; He became man and was crucified in order to accomplish
                                God’s salvation plan for humankind. He was dead, buried, and rose again from the dead on
                                the third day. He ascended into heaven and will come again in the future.

                                people into saved relations with God. He is the Comforter and Guide of all who receive
                                Jesus Christ as their Savior. He gives them gifts and strength to live with holiness and
                                serve with power.

                                against God, so death came to all people. The consequence of sin is death and separation
                                from God’s presence. Salvation can be obtained only through the illumination of the Holy
                                Spirit to repent and reconcile with God. Whoever receives Jesus Christ as Savior shall
                                not perish but have eternal life.
